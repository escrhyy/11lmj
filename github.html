      hi babi hehe, I hope this letter finds you well. actually, this is my first time writing a letter for someone I adore through the use of a webpage. HUEYYY! ios ba? <strong> (˵•̀ ᴗ-˵) </strong> this might be long since I have a lot to say so bear with me pls. First of all, I would like to thank you, not only for getting to know you but also for how our friendship has developed. You know naman na hindi ko talaga ineexpect na magiging ka-close kita e pc nga lang kita dati, lol. I wanted to say thank you also for everything you've done to me, couldn't thank you enough since it's a lot and I appreciate you for doing those kind of things to me, and wanna say sorry for not being good enough friend/baby sayo, like, yk, pakikipag communicate sayo but it wasn't really my intention to do that <strong> :c </strong> and sa mga pinagsasabi ko that time na nagpapagulo sayo <strong> :c </strong> i'm sorry <strong> :c </strong> anyways, kaya ko lang naman ginawa to para batiin ka ng <strong> Happy 3rd! </strong> idk kung paano ko siya itatawag, kung as a friend ba na may assurance or 'bebe'? <strong>.·°՞(≧□≦)՞°·.</strong> we're talking about friendship muna natin here ah? later na yung ano kasi gusto ko na magka-label. HUEYYY! just also want to say na, you're the best, and you'll always be. I'll always gonna give you the same energy and treatment you needed and deserve. and I know I'm not kind of friend/partner na who you will rant about random things, but whenever you feel alone and want someone to understand you, I'm here ah? I hope you don't hesitate to share everything with me kasi I'm fine with that and all. gagi naalala ko nanaman yung time na kinakausap mo ko sa plato tas nagpupuyat ka for me sa kadramahan ko, super thankful talaga ako sayo for that. mwaaaa <strong> (〃▽〃) </strong>
      <br>
      <strong> Always remember na, you have me, ah? if may random thoughts, rants or stories ka i-share mo lang sakin ^^. I love youuuuuuuu (〃▽〃) ♡ </strong>
